## Mining (CPU)

The miner is based on 0xBitcoin [miner](https://github.com/0xbitcoin/0xbitcoin-miner)

Download/clone the cooltoken repository, got to cool-miner, open `miner-config.json` file in any editor and paste your wallet address and private key. Do not change the gas price (1050000000) - it is 1.05 gwei. To change web3provider go to `index.js` file lines 16-17 (comment and remove comment to choose provider) and replace provider uri in `miner-config.json` 

```
